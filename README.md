# Artifical Intelligence -- 8-puzzle Solver (n-puzzle capable)

# Algorithms: 
	Uniform Cost Search
	A* with Manhattan
	A* with Misplaced Tile

# Contents:   
	This program implements three ways of solving an 8-puzzle (also capable of
	solving any n-puzzle with a few tweaks in input/output code). It prompts
	the user to input a puzzle (or use default) and then uses whichever selected
	algorithm to find a solution. The three algorithms are chosen to demonstrate
	the optimality of A* as well as the increased optimality given a better
	heuristic.
